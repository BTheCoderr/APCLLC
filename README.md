## Deployment

This site is deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

### Netlify Deployment Notes

If you encounter ESLint errors during deployment, they have been addressed in the `eslint.config.mjs` file. The most common issues were:

1. Unused imports (`AboutSection` in about/page.tsx and `Head` in page.tsx)
2. Unescaped apostrophes (`'`) in text content

The ESLint configuration has been updated to ignore these specific issues, but it's better to fix them properly by:
- Removing unused imports
- Using `&apos;` instead of `'` in JSX text content

To deploy to Netlify:

1. Push your changes to the GitHub repository
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Use the following build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
   - Node.js version: 18.x (or latest LTS)
