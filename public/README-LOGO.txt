LOGO INSTRUCTIONS

The website is designed to use your APC LLC logo image. Please save your logo as:

Filename: APC-logo.png
Location: /public folder of this project

The logo you shared shows:
- "APC" in red
- "LLC" in gold/yellow
- A cargo van in gold/yellow
- Black background

For best results, save the logo with a transparent background if possible, at a size of at least 350x350 pixels.

Once you've added the logo file, it will automatically appear in the:
- Navbar (top left)
- Hero section
- About section
- Footer

If you need any assistance adding or adjusting the logo, please let me know.
